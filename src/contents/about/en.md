### Sutan Gading Fadhillah Nasution

---

***Software Engineer*** who specialized in ***Frontend*** on *Full-time* work, and also has some ability to code in ***Backend*** on Freelance/Side work. Very passionate to explore about modern mobile and web technology while taking into consideration the latest trends and techniques.

Would be a fast learner in doing new things and building good teamwork either. Also, made several side or *open-source* projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/gadingnst) for fun, and maybe already useful for people who have used it.
