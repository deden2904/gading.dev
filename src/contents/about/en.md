I'm ***Software Engineer*** who specialized in ***Frontend*** on *Full-time* work, and also has some ability to code in ***Backend*** on *Freelance/Side-work*. Very passionate to explore about modern mobile and web technology while taking into consideration the latest trends and techniques.

I would be a fast learner in doing new things and building good teamwork either. Also, made several side or *open-source* projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/gadingnst) for fun, and maybe already useful for people who have used it.

#### What I’m passionate about
I’m a *long-life learner person*. Online developer communities, OSS projects, mentors sharing their knowledge (for free & paid), colleagues, and friends, all those people helped me get to where I am today. And I’m very grateful for that. Early on I also helped out people, contributed to some OSS projects and published my own projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/gadingnst?tab=repositories). That’s how I realized that I enjoy technical writing like in blog or software documentation, and creating educational content & interacting with another developers.

#### Spelling my name

#### About this website
I built this website using *JAMStack* with *Next.js* technology, you can check the source-code [here](https://github.com/gadingnst/gading.dev). All content on this website mostly is written using *Markdown* (no database included). If you want to make one too, then I suggest you learn about *JAMStack* first, *JAMStack* technology is quite extensive, there are many technologies or frameworks that you can use to build a *JAMStack-based* website, not just using *Next.js*. You can *DYOR*.

In building this website, I really paid attention to all aspects related to *performance* and *SEO*. Therefore, I'll display the website *performance* report on this page, and it will always be updated periodically. Thanks to [Anku Parihar](https://github.com/ankurparihar) for making [Readme Pagespeed Insight](https://github.com/ankurparihar/readme-pagespeed-insights) that can generate *performance* report of this website automatically. Here's the last updated report:
