I'm ***Software Engineer*** who specialized in ***Frontend*** on *Full-time* work, and also has some ability to code in ***Backend*** on Freelance/Side work. Very passionate to explore about modern mobile and web technology while taking into consideration the latest trends and techniques.

I would be a fast learner in doing new things and building good teamwork either. Also, made several side or *open-source* projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/gadingnst) for fun, and maybe already useful for people who have used it.

#### What I’m passionate about
I’m a *long-life learner Developer*. Online developer communities, OSS projects, educators sharing their knowledge (for free & paid), mentors, colleagues, and friends, all those people helped me get to where I am today. And I’m very grateful for that. Early on I also helped out people, contributed to some OSS projects and published my own projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/gadingnst?tab=repositories). That’s how I realized that I enjoy technical writing like in blog or software documentation, and creating educational content and managing & interacting with communities.
